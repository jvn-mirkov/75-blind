# Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

## Python

```python
def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
    minPrice, maxProfit  = float('inf'), 0
    for price in prices:
        if price < minPrice:
            minPrice = price
        elif price - minPrice > maxProfit:
            maxProfit = price - minPrice
    return maxProfit
```
